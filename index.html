                <p>
                    My name is Tom Jorgensen, and I am currently a Cloud Administrator for an IT Consulting company based out of Long Island, NY with an office in Omaha, NE. I started as an intern in 2016 and just celebrated my 6th anniversary in April 2022. I work primarily with Amazon Web Services, with a focus on their CDK and SDK products. I am currently in pursuit of his BS in Management Information Systems at UNO, aiming to graduate in December 2022.
                    
                    During my free time, I enjoy getting out on a bike ride, playing with my cat Fio, and watching the Boston Celtics!
