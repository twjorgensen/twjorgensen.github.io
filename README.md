# ISQA3900 Activity 2

This repository is for Activity 2 in the ISQA3900 class at UNO. The purpose of this activity is to demonstrate the creation of a couple of web pages with content, and using Git and GitHub for source control.

## Contents

This repository has two main files: [index.html](https://github.com/twjorgensen/3900Activity2/blob/master/index.html) and [fio.html](https://github.com/twjorgensen/3900Activity2/blob/master/fio.html). The [css](https://github.com/twjorgensen/3900Activity2/tree/master/css) folder contains the [main.css](https://github.com/twjorgensen/3900Activity2/blob/master/css/main.css) file used throughout the .html files for formatting and design.

## Usage

The pages can be displayed by copying the repository locally to your computer and opening the index.html from your file explorer. Alternatively, this repository is also hosted using GitHub Pages and can be viewed from the internet.
